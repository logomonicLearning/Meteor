Enter Note:PHP: 
stands for personal home page and is a hypertext preprocessor. It was made in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. it was made fro
m several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, and is mainly used as a mediator between the front-end (browser html, css,js) and back-end(database, files). In order to use PHP, you must insall XAMPP(cross-platform apache mariaDB, php,python and perl). start the xampp control panel, then enter the correct apache configuration by choosing a port no in the httpd.conf file. then connect to the databases. you can then access the database through phpmyadmin which should be downloaded from phpmyadmin.net, remember to donate :) 

some of the main things to do with php are:
1) connect to a database, 
2) CRUD a database i.e. inserting, searching and returning info and insert in html. 
3) form-validations, It usually involves the use of mysqli_... command which also requires knowledge of MYSQL. it is therefore recommended that you learn SQL first. before learning php. otherwise youre limited to just file manipulation.
for backend webdevelopment

note that besides database manipulation, php can also acess and modify files in other formats such as txt, csv excel. just read about a comparison between PHPexcel vs PHPSpreadsheet, which seem like frameworks.
